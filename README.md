# K-means-Clustering

K-means clustering is a machine learning algorithm used for grouping similar data points together in a dataset. It works by dividing the dataset into k clusters and assigning each data point to the nearest cluster.

Imagine you have a dataset of customer information including age, income, and spending habits, and you want to group customers into different segments based on their spending patterns. K-means clustering can help you to group similar customers together and identify different customer segments.

In K-means clustering, the value of k is chosen by the user and represents the number of clusters to create. Once k is chosen, the algorithm randomly selects k data points as the initial centroids for each cluster. The algorithm then assigns each data point to the nearest centroid based on the distance metric used.

Once the initial assignment is complete, the algorithm calculates the mean of each cluster and updates the centroid. The algorithm then reassigns each data point to the nearest centroid based on the updated centroids. This process is repeated until the centroids no longer change or a maximum number of iterations is reached.

Once the algorithm has converged, each data point is assigned to a cluster based on the final centroids. This allows you to identify different groups of customers based on their spending patterns.

K-means clustering is a useful tool for identifying patterns and relationships in data. It is commonly used in marketing, customer segmentation, and image processing. However, it can be sensitive to the choice of k and the initial placement of centroids, and may not always produce optimal results. Overall, K-means clustering is a powerful tool for grouping similar data points together and identifying different clusters in a dataset
